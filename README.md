To run.

In one terminal cd into the backEnd directory and use `python manage.py runserver` to start the backend application. 
In another terminal cd into the frontEnd directory and use `ng serve` to start up the angular app on the front end.

Open up localhost:4200 (or whichever port ng serve suggests) and you would be able to see the list of polices.
